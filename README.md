# __Google Data Analytics Certificate - Capstone Project__<br>
***
## Bike Sharing - Case Study
This is the first project done for the Google certificate course. The approached to work on this project was guided in 3 different ways:<br>

- Using Spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheet)<br>
- Using Structure Query Language (SQL)<br>
- Using R and R Studio<br>

But I decided to make my analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks as is the tool I have more experience with and Try a little bit of Tableu to share the visualizations.<br>

### A little about the company:<br>
