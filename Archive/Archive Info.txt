For the project I used the last 12 months(as of October 2021).

The files were downloaded from:
https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Put them in this Folder and name them like this (October 2020 to September 2021:

202010-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202011-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202012-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202101-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202102-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202103-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202104-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202105-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202106-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202107-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202108-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv
202109-Cyclistic-tripdata.csv

Or changed the name on the ipynb file.

The reason I did not upload them to GitHub is because total size of the files was 958.4 MB
